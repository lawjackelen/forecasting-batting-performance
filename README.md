## Forecasting Baseball WAA (Wins Above Average)

### Problem Statement (as of now)
Using a player's previous performance, create a forecast for the next season's WAA. Compare the trends of features like runs_batting, runs_br, etc. against other players with those trends and use their next season's known values to help predict the WAA. This can be a three-year to five-year lookback depending on dataset size.
